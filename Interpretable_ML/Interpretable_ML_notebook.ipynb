    "# Telco Customer Churn Analysis  \n",
    "\n",
    "This repository contains the code and analysis for understanding and predicting customer churn using a dataset from a telecommunications company. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn/code). The goal is to identify factors contributing to churn and build interpretable models to predict customers at risk of leaving the company.  \n",

    "## Instructions  \n",
    "\n",
    "This project involves the following tasks:  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to Check Assumptions**  \n",
    "- Perform exploratory analysis of the dataset to examine relationships between features and the target variable (churn).  \n",
    "- Use appropriate visualizations and statistical methods to assess whether assumptions for linear regression, logistic regression, and Generalized Additive Models (GAM) are met.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Linear Regression**  \n",
    "- Treat the churn variable as a continuous variable (e.g., 0 for staying, 1 for churning).  \n",
    "- Build a linear regression model to predict churn.  \n",
    "- Interpret the coefficients and evaluate the model's performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Logistic Regression**  \n",
    "- Treat churn as a binary variable.  \n",
    "- Build a logistic regression model to predict the probability of churn.  \n",
    "- Interpret the coefficients.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Generalized Additive Model (GAM)**  \n",
    "- Build a GAM to model non-linear relationships between customer features and churn.  \n",
    "- Interpret the results of the GAM model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Model Comparison**  \n",
    "- Compare the performance and interpretability of the linear regression, logistic regression, and GAM models.  \n",
    "- Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.  \n",
    "- Provide recommendations on which model(s) the telecommunications company should use to address their customer churn problem.  \n",
